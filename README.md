# Hi, I'm Eve 👋  
Backend & Distributed Systems Engineer

I'm a software engineer focused on **scalable backend systems**, **search infrastructure**, and **end-to-end product development**.  
I care deeply about performance, reliability, and building systems that behave correctly under real-world constraints.

**Core Interests:** distributed systems, low-latency retrieval, search infrastructure, data pipelines, performance engineering.

## Featured Projects

### AI Document Intelligence Platform  
**FastAPI · Postgres/pgvector · React · OpenAI**  
An end-to-end RAG system designed for low-latency semantic search and grounded LLM answers.

- Built a scalable embedding + retrieval pipeline supporting **30k–50k embeddings**  
- Achieved **<50ms vector search latency** (pgvector)  
- Implemented ingestion throughput of **5–10 docs/sec** with batching  
- Developed a **benchmarking harness** for testing 10+ chunking and retrieval strategies  
- Designed heuristics (heading-aware segmentation, locality scoring, RR fusion) that improve semantic relevance

### Distributed Peer-to-Peer Auction System  
**Python · UDP/TCP**  
A fault-tolerant distributed bidding system demonstrating correctness under unreliable transport.

- Combined UDP for low-latency bid propagation and TCP for reliable replication  
- Supported **concurrent bidders** with delivery guarantees  
- Reduced bid propagation latency by **30%**  
- Implemented replay-safe messaging, consistency checks, and recovery mechanisms
